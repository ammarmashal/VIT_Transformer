# Vision Transformer (ViT) Implementation from Scratch ðŸš€

This repository contains an implementation of the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** architecture from scratch, as well as experiments using **pretrained ViT models**. The project showcases the inner workings of the ViT model, providing a deeper understanding of its components and their role in modern computer vision.


## âœ¨ Features
- Fully functional ViT implementation from scratch.
- Easy-to-use pipeline for fine-tuning pretrained ViT models.
- Modular, well-documented codebase for learning and experimentation.
- Customizable for different datasets and tasks.

ðŸ“Š Results
Model	Dataset	Accuracy	Epochs
ViT from Scratch	CIFAR-10	69.3%	50
Pretrained ViT Fine-Tuned	CIFAR-10	97.1%	20
